        <p>
        La Besnardiere (The Bear Keeper's Cottage) is a 17th century farmhouse and gite centered around a large courtyard, 
        typical of the Maine et Loire region, set in five acres of French countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
        The farmhouse has original oak-beamed rooms and inglenook fireplaces and is available for a welcoming B&B.<br/>
        Across the courtyard is the gite accommodation which has been beautifully restored to create light and 
        spacious accommodation for an enjoyable and relaxing holiday.<br/>
        One of the joys of a visit is the safe spacious area in which children can relax and play 
        in safety with child friendly animals just waiting for their attention.

        in the morning for B&B residents and self-catering guests. The dining room offers whole food 
        and vegetarian meals prepared from fresh organically grown vegetables from our own kitchen 
        garden with eggs from our free range chickens. In the summer meals are served "al fresco" 
        under the trees or in the open barn, with the light of the stars and candles on the tables. 
        Many a good evening has been spent eating a delicious three course meal, emptying a bottle 
        of wine and enjoying the company of new and old friends all whilst being serenaded by a choir
        of cicadas and crickets.
